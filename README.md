# Flashcard-Generator

So this is a flash-card/trivia game, built to read two different card-types.

The types are partially hidden, word guess, and question/answer. These movie based trivia games will help you learn good trivia to take and use with you at parties or other gatherings with people.

Please install npm request and inquirer packages for usage.

Thank you, and enjoy!
